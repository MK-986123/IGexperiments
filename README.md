# IGExperiments

Allow you to enable developer options in Instagram!

It has been tested on v269 but it might not work for all versions because classes name and methods name often change :/

You will need Lsposed/Xposed framework to use it!

I would like directly use the loadAndLaunchDeveloperOptions method but I did not found how to do for the moment, so if you do, do not hesitate! :)
