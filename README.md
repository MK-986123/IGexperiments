# IGExperiments

Allow you to enable developer options in Instagram!

When the module is enabled, kill Instagram and long press home button. You will be able go to developer page and sometimes other stuff.

It might not work for all versions because classes name and methods name often change from update to another :/

You will need Lsposed/Xposed framework to use it.(Root devices)

LSPatch(Non-Root devices)
